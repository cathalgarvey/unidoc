# UniDoc

[UniDoc](http://unidoc.io) is a fast and powerful open source library for document manipulation starting off as a PDF
toolkit. This is a commercial library written and supported by the owners
of the FoxyUtils.com website.

This library is used to power many of the services offered by the FoxyUtils.com website. The goal is to extend it to
eventually support all of the offered services.

## About

Unidoc is a free software document editing library, originally produced by FoxyUtils.

It was licensed under the AGPL, with additional terms that were not compatible with the AGPL;
in this fork, I have removed those terms, as the AGPL explicitly allows (so, as the authors
therefore explicitly permitted me to do, under the AGPL license).

I doubt they will merge these changes, but I'm happy to receive PRs here from others who wish
to collaborate on a Free Software document library for Go. I invite the Unidoc authors, however,
to consider revising their non-free stance, and to merge these edits and proceed under an AGPL
license. Restrictions and anti-customer measures are not required for a thriving enterprise.

Except for judicious deletions in keeping with the above, the below is a reproduction of the
original readme:
